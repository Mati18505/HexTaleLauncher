# Hextale Launcher
This is the Hextale Nostale client launcher. 
Its purpose is to make it easy to download and run the Nostale client.

## Story
The Nostale client was updated frequently and players had to re-download it each time. Additionally, players had to first learn about the existence of the update. If they launched the game without the update, the game didn't work and they didn't know why.

That's why the Hextale Launcher was created.

## Features
- Automatic updates.
- Versioning: Instead of downloading the entire game with each client update, this launcher includes a version control system that tracks changed files and downloads only those that have changed.
